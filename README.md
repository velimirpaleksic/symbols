# Symbols Copy Utility

A simple and interactive webpage to explore and copy commonly used symbols with a single click. This project organizes symbols into categories like mathematical symbols, checkmarks, arrows, astrological signs, currency symbols, and more for easy accessibility.

## Features
- **Category-wise Organization**: Symbols are grouped into logical categories (Math, Arrows, Currency, Chess, Musical Notes, Weather, etc.).
- **One-Click Copy**: Quickly copy any symbol to your clipboard by clicking a button.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for seamless usage across devices.
- **Customizable**: Easily add or modify symbol sets in the HTML.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for fast loading.

## How It Works
- The symbols are displayed in sections.
- Clicking a button calls a JavaScript function (`Copy()`) that copies the corresponding symbol to the clipboard.
